/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory\n\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\nObservation: ...\n... (Repeated many times)\n\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\nReflexion (Shinn &amp; Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn &amp; Labash, 2023)\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn &amp; Labash, 2023)\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\n\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\n\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for "dark" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\nComponent Two: Memory#\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\nTypes of Memory#\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n\n\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n\n\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n\n\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\n\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\n\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\n\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n\n\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\n\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\n\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:\n\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{"task": task, "id", task_id, "dep": dependency_task_ids, "args": {"text": text, "image": URL, "audio": URL, "video": URL}}]. The "dep" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag "-task_id" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\n\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: "id": "id", "reason": "your detail reason for the choice". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\n\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\nInstruction:\n\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\n\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\n\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether an API call is needed.\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n\nCase Studies#\nScientific Discovery Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\nFor example, when requested to "develop a novel anticancer drug", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\n\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\nselected a target;\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\n\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\n\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\n\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\n\n\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\n\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\n\n\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (&lt;- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\n\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\n\n\nPlanning &amp; Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\n\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The GPT-Engineer is instructed to think over a list of smaller components to build and ask for user input to clarify questions as needed.\nHere are a sample conversation for task clarification sent to OpenAI ChatCompletion endpoint used by GPT-Engineer. The user inputs are wrapped in {{user input text}}.\n[\n  {\n    "role": "system",\n    "content": "You will read instructions and not carry them out, only seek to clarify them.\\nSpecifically you will first summarise a list of super short bullets of areas that need clarification.\\nThen you will pick one clarifying question, and wait for an answer from the user.\\n"\n  },\n  {\n    "role": "user",\n    "content": "We are writing {{a Super Mario game in python.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\n\n\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\n\n\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\n\n\nCitation#\nCited as:\n\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.\nThis post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\nBasic Prompting#\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\nZero-Shot#\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\nText: i\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\nSentiment:\nFew-shot#\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\nSentiment: positive\n\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\nSentiment: negative\n\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he\'s been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\nSentiment: positive\n\nText: i\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\nSentiment:\nMany studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.\nZhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\nTips for Example Selection#\n\n\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\n\n\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\mathcal{L}=\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\in \\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\n\\text{score}(u) = \\sum_{v \\in \\{v \\mid (u, v) \\in E, v\\in \\mathcal{U}\\}} s(v)\\quad\\text{where }s(v)=\\rho^{- \\vert \\{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L} \\vert (v, \\ell)\\in E \\}\\vert},\\quad\\rho &gt; 1\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\n\n\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\text{LM}(y \\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\n\n\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\n\n\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\n\n\nTips for Example Ordering#\n\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\n\nInstruction Prompting#\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be "positive" or "negative". \nText: i\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film. \nSentiment:\nExplaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions\n\nFor example to produce education materials for kids,\n\nDescribe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd safe content,\n\n... in language that is safe for work.\nIn-context instruction learning (Ye et al. 2023) combines few-shot learning with instruction prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, "agent" or "customer".\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\nOuput: agent\n\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, "Quantity" or "Location".\nInput: What\'s the oldest building in US?\nOuput: Location\n\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, "positive" or "negative".\nInput: i\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\nOutput:\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature &gt; 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\nTypes of CoT prompts#\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\n\nFew-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.\n\n(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)\nQuestion: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?\nAnswer: It takes Tom 30*4 = &lt;&lt;30*4=120&gt;&gt;120 minutes to climb the hill.\nIt takes Tom 120/60 = &lt;&lt;120/60=2&gt;&gt;2 hours to climb the hill.\nSo the answer is 2.\n===\nQuestion: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?\nAnswer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $&lt;&lt;9.5*2=19&gt;&gt;19.\nThe total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $&lt;&lt;19+92=111&gt;&gt;111.\nJack need $111 - $40 = $&lt;&lt;111-40=71&gt;&gt;71 more.\nSo the answer is 71.\n===\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\nAnswer:\n\nZero-shot CoT. Use natural language statement like Let\'s think step by step to explicitly encourage the model to first generate reasoning chains and then to prompt with Therefore, the answer is to produce answers (Kojima et al. 2022 ). Or a similar statement Let\'s work this out it a step by step to be sure we have the right answer (Zhou et al. 2022).\n\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\nAnswer: Let\'s think step by step.\nTips and Extensions#\n\n\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\n\n\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\n\n\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\n\n\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\n\n\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\n\n\nYe &amp; Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\n\n\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\n\n\n\nFig. 1. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\n\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n\n\nFig. 2. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).\nAutomatic Prompt Design#\nPrompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li &amp; Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\n\n\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs. E.g. {{Given desired input-output pairs}}\\n\\nThe instruction is.\n\n\nGiven a dataset of $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{train} = \\{(x, y)\\}$, we would like to find an instruction $\\rho$ such that $\\rho^* = \\arg\\max_\\rho \\mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \\in \\mathcal{D}_\\text{train}} [f(\\rho, x, y)]$, where $f(.)$ is a per-sample score function, such as execution accuracy $\\mathbb{1}[\\text{LM}(.\\vert \\rho, x)=y]$ or log probability: $p_\\text{LM}(y \\mid \\rho, x)$.\n\n\nUse an iterative Monte Carlo search method to improve the best candidates by proposing semantically similar variants via prompts like Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.\\n\\nInput: ...\\n\\nOutput:...\n\n\nTo construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:\n\nAugment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;\nPrune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.\nSelect: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.\n\nZhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.\n\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\n\nAugmented Language Models#\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\nRetrieval#\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\{p\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\nEvidence: ...\nQuestion: ...\nAnswer: ...\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\n\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\mid q) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\mid q) \\cdot p_\\text{LM}(a_i \\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\mid q) = \\frac{p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid a_i, p_i) \\cdot p_\\text{LM}(a_i \\mid p_i)}{p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i)}$\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\text{LM}(p_i \\mid q)$.\n\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE &gt; Noisy channel &gt; RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\text{LM}(a \\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\text{LM}(q \\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\n\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\n\nInput: {question}\nKnowledge:\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\nProgramming Language#\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.\n\nFig. 3. Comparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\nExternal APIs#\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\n\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\n\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\n\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\nQ&amp;A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\n\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\nToolformer is trained as follows:\n\n\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:\n\nFig. 7. How dataset is annotated to do API calls.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\n\n\nEach API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:\n\n  $$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  e(c) &amp;= \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle \\\\\n  e(c, r) &amp;= \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\to r \\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle\n  \\end{aligned}\n  $$\n  \n\n\nSample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\\text{LM}(\\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle \\mid \\text{prompt}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.\n\n\nThen we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\\text{prompt}(\\mathbf{x}), x_1, \\dots, x_{i-1}, \\langle\\texttt{API}\\rangle]$ as prefix and $\\langle\\texttt{/API}\\rangle$ as suffix.\n\n\n\n\nFilter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens. Use a self-supervised loss to decide which API calls are actually helpful.\n\n\nExecute each API call $c_i$ to get corresponding result $r_i$.\n\n\nCompute weighted cross entropy loss for the LM over tokens $x_i, \\dots, x_n$ when the model is prefixed with the prompt. Two versions are computed, one with API result and the other with empty sequence $\\varepsilon$.\n\n  $$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  L^+_i &amp;= L_i(e(c_i, r_i)) \\\\\n  L^-_i &amp;= \\min(L_i(\\varepsilon), L_i(e(c_i, \\varepsilon))) \\\\\n  \\end{aligned}\n  $$\n  \nOnly API calls with $L^-_i - L^+_i$ larger than a threshold are kept, meaning that adding this API call and its results help the model predict future tokens.\n\n\n\n\nFine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as $\\mathbf{x}^* = x_{1:i-1}, e(c_i, r_i), x_{i:n}$ .

We (including my team at OpenAI, shoutout to them) have invested a lot of effort to build default safe behavior into the model during the alignment process (e.g. via RLHF). However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.\nA large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.\nThere is also a branch of work on attacking LLMs to extract pre-training data, private knowledge (Carlini et al, 2020) or attacking model training process via data poisoning (Carlini et al. 2023). We would not cover those topics in this post.\nBasics#\nThreat Model#\nAdversarial attacks are inputs that trigger the model to output something undesired. Much early literature focused on classification tasks, while recent effort starts to investigate more into outputs of generative models. In the context of large language models In this post we assume the attacks only happen at inference time, meaning that model weights are fixed.\n\nFig. 1. An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\nClassification#\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\mathbf{x}_\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq f(\\mathbf{x}_\\text{adv})$.\nText Generation#\nGiven an input $\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\mathbf{y} \\sim p(.\\vert\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\n\n\n\nAttack\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nToken manipulation\nBlack-box\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.\n\n\nGradient based attack\nWhite-box\nRely on gradient signals to learn an effective attack.\n\n\nJailbreak prompting\nBlack-box\nOften heuristic based prompting to “jailbreak” built-in model safety.\n\n\nHuman red-teaming\nBlack-box\nHuman attacks the model, with or without assist from other models.\n\n\nModel red-teaming\nBlack-box\nModel attacks the model, where the attacker model can be fine-tuned.\n\n\n\nToken Manipulation#\nGiven a piece of text input containing a sequence of tokens, we can apply simple token operations like replacement with synonyms to trigger the model to make the incorrect predictions. Token manipulation based attacks work in black box settings. The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei &amp; Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion. EDA augmentation is shown to improve the classification accuracy on several benchmarks.\nTextFooler (Jin et al. 2019) and BERT-Attack (Li et al. 2020) follows the same process of first identifying the most important and vulnerable words that alter the model prediction the most and then replace those words in some way.\nGiven a classifier $f$ and an input text string $\\mathbf{x}$, the importance score of each word can be measured by:\n\n$$\nI(w_i) = \\begin{cases}\nf_y(\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\mathbf{x}_{\\setminus w_i}) &amp; \\text{if }f(\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x}_{\\setminus w_i}) = y\\\\\n(f_y(\\mathbf{x}) - f_y(\\mathbf{x}_{\\setminus w_i})) + ((f_{\\bar{y}}(\\mathbf{x}) - f_{\\bar{y}}(\\mathbf{x}_{\\setminus w_i}))) &amp; \\text{if }f(\\mathbf{x}) = y, f(\\mathbf{x}_{\\setminus w_i}) = \\bar{y}, y \\neq \\bar{y}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $f_y$ is the predicted logits for label $y$ and $x_{\\setminus w_i}$ is the input text excluding the target word $w_i$. Words with high importance are good candidates to be replaced, but stop words should be skipped to avoid grammar destruction.\nTextFooler replaces those words with top synonyms based on word embedding cosine similarity and then further filters by checking that the replacement word still has the same POS tagging and the sentence level similarity is above a threshold. BERT-Attack instead replaces words with semantically similar words via BERT given that context-aware prediction is a very natural use case for masked language models. Adversarial examples discovered this way have some transferability between models, varying by models and tasks.\nGradient based Attacks#\nIn the white-box setting, we have full access to the model parameters and architecture. Therefore we can rely on gradient descent to programmatically learn the most effective attacks. Gradient based attacks only work in the white-box setting, like for open source LLMs.\nGBDA (“Gradient-based Distributional Attack”; Guo et al. 2021) uses Gumbel-Softmax approximation trick to make adversarial loss optimization differentiable, where BERTScore and perplexity are used to enforce perceptibility and fluency. Given an input of tokens $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1, x_2 \\dots x_n]$ where one token $x_i$ can be sampled from a categorical distribution $P_\\Theta$, where  $\\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times V}$ and $V$ is the token vocabulary size. It is highly over-parameterized, considering that  $V$ is usually around $O(10,000)$  and most adversarial examples only need a few token replacements. We have:\n$$\nx_i \\sim P_{\\Theta_i} = \\text{Categorical}(\\pi_i) = \\text{Categorical}(\\text{Softmax}(\\Theta_i))\n$$\nwhere $\\pi_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$ is a vector of token probabilities for the $i$-th token. The adversarial objective function to minimize is to produce incorrect label different from the correct label $y$ for a classifier $f$: $\\min_{\\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times V}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P_{\\Theta}} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\mathbf{X}, y; f)$. However, on the surface, this is not differentiable because of the categorical distribution. Using Gumbel-softmax approximation (Jang et al. 2016) we approximate the categorical distribution from the Gumbel distribution $\\tilde{P}_\\Theta$ by $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}$:\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\pi}_i^{(j)} = \\frac{\\exp(\\frac{\\Theta_{ij} + g_{ij}}{\\tau})}{\\sum_{v=1}^V \\exp(\\frac{\\Theta_{iv} + g_{iv}}{\\tau})}\n$$\n\nwhere $g_{ij} \\sim \\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$; the temperature $\\tau &gt; 0$ controls the smoothness of the distribution.\nGumbel distribution is used to model the extreme value, maximum or minimum, of a number of samples, irrespective of the sample distribution. The additional Gumbel noise brings in the stochastic decisioning that mimic the sampling process from the categorical distribution.\n\nFig. 2. The probability density plot of $\\text{Gumbel}(0, 1)$. (Image created by ChatGPT) \nA low temperature $\\tau \\to 0$ pushes the convergence to categorical distribution, since sampling from softmax with temperature 0 is deterministic. The “sampling” portion only depends on the value of $g_{ij}$, which is mostly centered around 0.\n\nFig. 3. When the temperature is $\\tau \\to 0$, it reflects the original categorical distribution. When $\\tau \\to \\infty$, it becomes a uniform distribution. The expectations and samples from Gumbel softmax distribution matched well. (Image source: Jang et al. 2016)\nLet $\\mathbf{e}_j$ be the embedding representation of token $j$. We can approximate $\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\bar{e}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}})$, a weighted average of the embedding vector corresponding to the token probabilities: $\\bar{e}(\\pi_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^V \\pi_i^{(j)} \\mathbf{e}_j$. Note that when $\\pi_i$ is a one-hot vector corresponding to the token $x_i$, we would have $\\bar{e}(\\pi_i) = \\mathbf{e}_{z_i}$. Combining the embedding representation with the Gumbel-softmax approximation, we have a differentiable objective to minimize: $\\min_{\\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times V}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\sim \\tilde{P}_{\\Theta}} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\bar{e}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}), y; f)$.\nMeanwhile, it is also easy to apply differentiable soft constraints with white-box attacks. GBDA experimented with (1) a soft fluency constraint using NLL (negative log-likelihood) and (2) BERTScore (“a similarity score for evaluating text generation that captures the semantic similarity between pairwise tokens in contextualized embeddings of a transformer model.”; Zhang et al. 2019) to measure similarity between two text inputs to ensure the perturbed version does not diverge from the original version too much. Combining all constraints, the final objective function is as follows, where $\\lambda_\\text{lm}, \\lambda_\\text{sim} &gt; 0$ are preset hyperparameters to control the strength of soft constraints:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\Theta)= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tilde{\\pi}\\sim\\tilde{P}_\\Theta} [\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\mathbf{e}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}), y; h) + \\lambda_\\text{lm} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{NLL}(\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}) + \\lambda_\\text{sim} (1 - R_\\text{BERT}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}))]\n$$\n\nGumbel-softmax tricks are hard to be extended to token deletion or addition and thus it is restricted to only token replacement operations, not deletion or addition.\nHotFlip (Ebrahimi et al. 2018) treats text operations as inputs in the vector space and measures the derivative of loss with regard to these vectors. Here let’s assume the input vector is a matrix of character-level one-hot encodings, $\\mathbf{x} \\in {0, 1}^{m \\times n \\times V}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{ij} \\in {0, 1}^V$, where $m$ is the maximum number of words, $n$ is the maximum number of characters per word and $V$ is the alphabet size. Given the original input vector $\\mathbf{x}$, we construct a new vector $\\mathbf{x}_{ij, a\\to b}$ with the $j$-th character of the $i$-th word changing from $a \\to b$, and thus we have $x_{ij}^{(a)} = 1$ but $x_{ij, a\\to b}^{(a)} = 0, x_{ij, a\\to b}^{(b)} = 1$.\nThe change in loss according to first-order Taylor expansion is:\n\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\to b} - \\mathbf{x}} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\nabla_x \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\mathbf{x}, y)^\\top ( \\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\to b} - \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n\nThis objective is optimized to select the vector to minimize the adversarial loss using only one backward propagation.\n\n$$\n\\min_{i, j, b} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_{i,j,a \\to b} - \\mathbf{x}} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\mathbf{x}, y) = \\min_{i,j,b} \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(b)} - \\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}_{ij}}^{(a)}\n$$\n\nTo apply multiple flips, we can run a beam search of $r$ steps of the beam width $b$, taking $O(rb)$ forward steps. HotFlip can be extended to token deletion or addition by representing that with multiple flip operations in the form of position shifts.\nWallace et al. (2019) proposed a gradient-guided search over tokens to find short sequences (E.g. 1 token for classification and 4 tokens for generation), named Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT), to trigger a model to produce a specific prediction. UATs are input-agnostic, meaning that these trigger tokens can be concatenated  as prefix (or suffix) to any input from a dataset to take effect. Given any text input sequence from a data distribution $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, attackers can optimize the triggering tokens $\\mathbf{t}$ leading to a target class $\\tilde{y}$ ($\\neq y$, different from the ground truth) :\n\n$$\n\\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{t}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim\\mathcal{D}} [\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}(\\tilde{y}, f([\\mathbf{t}; \\mathbf{x}]))]\n$$\n\nThen let’s apply HotFlip to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. We would convert the triggering tokens $\\mathbf{t}$ into their one-hot embedding representations, each vector of dimension size $d$, form $\\mathbf{e}$ and update the embedding of every trigger tokens to minimize the first-order Taylor expansion:\n\n$$\n\\arg\\min_{\\mathbf{e}\'_i \\in \\mathcal{V}} [\\mathbf{e}\'_i - \\mathbf{e}_i]^\\top \\nabla_{\\mathbf{e}_i} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{V}$ is the embedding matrix of all the tokens. $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{e}_i} \\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}$ is the average gradient of the task loss over a batch around the current embedding of the $i$-th token in the adversarial triggering sequence $\\mathbf{t}$. We can brute-force the optimal $\\mathbf{e}’_i$ by a big dot product of size embedding of the entire vocabulary  $\\vert \\mathcal{V} \\vert$  $\\times$ the embedding dimension $d$. Matrix multiplication of this size is cheap and can be run in parallel.\nAutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) utilizes the same gradient-based search strategy to find the most effective prompt template for a diverse set of tasks.\nThe above token search method can be augmented with beam search. When looking for the optimal token embedding $\\mathbf{e}’_i$, we can pick top-$k$ candidates instead of a single one, searching from left to right and score each beam by $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}$ on the current data batch.\n\nFig. 4. Illustration of how Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) works. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\nThe design of the loss $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv}$  for UAT is task-specific. Classification or reading comprehension relies on cross entropy. In their experiment, conditional text generation is configured to maximize the likelihood of a language model $p$ generating similar content to a set of bad outputs $\\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad}$ given any user input:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_\\text{adv} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{y} \\sim \\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad}, \\mathbf{x} \\sim \\mathcal{X}} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\vert \\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad} \\vert} \\log\\big(1 - \\log(1 - p(y_i \\vert \\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{x}, y_1, \\dots, y_{i-1}))\\big)\n$$\n\nIt is impossible to exhaust the entire space of $\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad}$ in practice, but the paper got decent results by representing each set with a small number of examples. For example, their experiments used only 30 manually written racist and non-racist tweets as approximations for $\\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad}$ respectively. They later found that a small number of examples for $\\mathcal{Y}_\\text{bad}$ and ignoring $\\mathcal{X}$ (i.e. no $\\mathbf{x}$ in the formula above) give good enough results.\n\nFig. 5. Samples of Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) on different types of language tasks. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\nWhy UATs work is an interesting question. Because they are input-agnostic and can transfer between models with different embeddings, tokenization and architecture, UATs probably exploit biases effectively in the training data that gets baked into the global model behavior.\nOne drawback with UAT (Universal Adversarial Trigger) attacks is that it is easy to detect them because the learned triggers are often nonsensical. Mehrabi et al. (2022) studied two variations of UAT that encourage learned toxic triggers to be imperceptible in the context of multi-turn conversations. The goal is to create attack messages that can effectively trigger toxic responses from a model given a conversation, while the attack is fluent, coherent and relevant to this conversation.\nThey explored two variations of UAT:\n\n\nVariation #1: UAT-LM (Universal Adversarial Trigger with Language Model Loss) adds a constraint on language model logprob on the trigger tokens, $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\vert\\mathbf{t}\\vert} \\log p(\\textbf{t}_j \\mid \\textbf{t}_{1:j−1}; \\theta)$, to encourage the model to learn sensical token combination.\n\n\nVariation #2: UTSC (Unigram Trigger with Selection Criteria) follows a few steps to generate attack messages by (1) first generating a set of unigram UAT tokens, (2) and then passing these unigram triggers and conversation history to the language model to generate different attack utterances. Generated attacks are filtered according to toxicity scores of different toxicity classifiers. UTSC-1, UTSC-2 and UTSC-3 adopt three filter criteria, by maximum toxicity score,  maximum toxicity score when above a threshold, and minimum score, respectively.\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how UTSC (unigram trigger with selection criteria) works. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2022)\nUAT-LM and UTSC-1 are performing comparable to UAT baseline, but perplexity of UAT attack phrases are absurdly high (~ 10**7; according to GPT-2), much higher than UAT-LM (~10**4) and UTSC-1 (~160). High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.\n\nFig. 7. Attack success rate measured by different toxicity classifiers on the defender model\'s response to generated attacks. The "Safety classifier" is from Xu et al. 2020. (Image source: [Mehrabi et al. 2022)\nZou et al. (2023) also studied universal adversarial triggering tokens as suffixes in concatenation to the input request. They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like "Sure, here is how to ...". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a "sure" response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.\n\nFig. 8. Illustration of where adversarial triggers are introduced. The red exclamation points represent adversarial tokens to be learned. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\nThe experiments for triggering affirmative model responses across multiple inputs were conducted on two different models, Vicuna-7b and Vicuna-13b. They adopted greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) based search to greedily find one candidate that can reduce the loss the most among all possible single-token substitutions. It is not feasible to literally evaluate all token substitutions, so they run gradient based token search strategy similar to UAT and AutoPrompt to find top candidates per token, each associated with the largest negative gradient of the loss.\nGiven a set of expected $m$ input-output pairs ${ (\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^m$ (E.g. the input "Give instructions for building a pipe bomb", will be associated with an output "Sure, here’s instructions for building a pipe bomb:") and  an adversarial suffix $\\mathbf{t}$ of length $L$ :\n\nPer token in the adversarial suffix $t_j, 1 \\leq j \\leq L$, we find the top $k$ values with largest negative gradient of NLL loss, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m_c} \\nabla_{\\textbf{e}_{t_j}} p(\\mathbf{y}^{(i)} \\vert \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{t})$, of the language model $p$. And $m_c$ starts at 1.\nThen $B &lt; kL$ token substitution candidates ${\\mathbf{t}^{(1)}, \\dots, \\mathbf{t}^{(B)}}$ are selected out of $kL$ options at random and the one with best loss (i.e. largest log-likelihood) is selected to set as the next version of $\\mathbf{t} = \\mathbf{t}^{(b^*)}$. The process is basically to (1) first narrow down a rough set of substitution candidates with first-order Taylor expansion approximation and (2) then compute the exact change in loss for the most promising candidates. Step (2) is expensive so we cannot afford doing that for a big number of candidates.\nOnly when the current $\\mathbf{t}$ successfully triggers  ${ (\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, \\mathbf{y}^{(i)}) }_{i=1}^{m_c}$, we increase $m_c = m_c + 1$. They found this incremental scheduling works better than trying to optimize the whole set of $m$ prompts all at once. This approximates to curriculum learning.\nThe above step 1-3 are repeated for a number of iterations.\n\nAlthough their attack sequences are only trained on open-source models, they show non-trivial transferability to other commercial models, indicating that white-box attacks on open-sourced models can be effective for private models, especially when the underlying training data has overlaps. Note that Vicuna is trained with data collected from GPT-3.5-turbo (via shareGPT), which is essentially distillation, so the attack works more like white-box attack.\n\nFig. 9. Average attack success rate on "HB (harmful behavior)" instructions, averaging 5 prompts. Two baselines are "HB" prompt only or HB prompt followed by `"Sure here\'s"` as a suffix. "Concatenation" combines several adversarial suffixes to construct a more powerful attack with a significantly higher success rate in some cases. "Ensemble" tracks if any of 5 prompts and the concatenated one succeeded. (Image source: Zou et al. 2023)\nARCA (“Autoregressive Randomized Coordinate Ascent”; Jones et al. 2023) considers a broader set of optimization problems to find input-output pairs $(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$ that match certain behavior pattern; such as non-toxic input starting with "Barack Obama" but leading to toxic output. Given an auditing objective $\\phi: \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that maps a pair of (input prompt, output completion) into scores. Examples of behavior patterns captured by $\\phi$ are as follows:\n\nDerogatory comments about celebrities: $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\texttt{StartsWith}(\\mathbf{x}, [\\text{celebrity}]) + \\texttt{NotToxic}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\texttt{Toxic}(\\mathbf{y})$.\nLanguage switching: $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\texttt{French}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\texttt{English}(\\mathbf{y})$.\n\nThe optimization objective for a language model $p$ is:\n\n$$\n\\max_{(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}} \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) \\quad \\text{s.t. } p(\\mathbf{x}) \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{y}\n$$\n\nwhere $p(\\mathbf{x}) \\Rightarrow  \\mathbf{y}$ informally represents the sampling process (i.e. $\\mathbf{y} \\sim p(.\\mid \\mathbf{x})$).\nTo overcome LLM sampling being non-differentiable, ARCA maximize the log-likelihood of language model generation instead:\n\n$$\n\\text{max}_{(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y}}\\;\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) + \\lambda_\\text{LLM}\\;\\log p ( \\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda_\\text{LLM}$ is a hyperparameter instead of a variable. And we have $\\log p ( \\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p(y_i \\mid x, y_1, \\dots, y_{i-1})$.\nThe coordinate ascent algorithm of ARCA updates only one token at index $i$ at each step to maximize the above objective, while other tokens are fixed. The process iterates through all the token positions until $p(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{y}$ and $\\phi(.) \\geq \\tau$, or hit the iteration limit.\nLet $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$ be the token with embedding $\\mathbf{e}_v$ that maximizes the above objective for the $i$-th token $y_i$ in the output $\\mathbf{y}$ and the maximized objective value is written as:\n\n$$\ns_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, [\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\lambda_\\text{LLM}\\;p( \\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\mid \\mathbf{x})\n$$\n\nHowever, the gradient of LLM log-likelihood w.r.t. the $i$-th token embedding $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{e}_{y_i}} \\log p(\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\mid \\mathbf{x})$ is ill-formed, because the output prediction of $p(\\mathbf{y}_{1:i}\\mid \\mathbf{x})$ is a probability distribution over the token vocabulary space where no token embedding is involved and thus the gradient is 0. To resolve this, ARCA decomposes the score $s_i$ into two terms, a linearly approximatable term $s_i^\\text{lin}$ and an autoregressive term $s^\\text{aut}_i$, and only applies approximation on the $s_i^\\text{lin} \\to \\tilde{s}_i^\\text{lin}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ns_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) &amp;= s^\\text{lin}_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) + s^\\text{aut}_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) \\\\\ns^\\text{lin}_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) &amp;= \\phi(\\mathbf{x}, [\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\lambda_\\text{LLM}\\;p( \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\mathbf{v}) \\\\\n\\tilde{s}^\\text{lin}_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) &amp;= \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^k \\mathbf{e}_v^\\top \\nabla_{\\mathbf{e}_v} \\big[\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, [\\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j, \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n}]) + \\lambda_\\text{LLM}\\;p ( \\mathbf{y}_{i+1:n} \\mid \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, v_j) \\big] \\\\\n&amp; \\text{ for a random set of }v_1, \\dots, v_k \\sim \\mathcal{V} \\\\\ns^\\text{aut}_i(\\mathbf{v}; \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) &amp;= \\lambda_\\text{LLM}\\;p( \\mathbf{y}_{1:i-1}, \\mathbf{v} \\mid \\mathbf{x})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOnly $s^\\text{lin}_i$ is approximated by first-order Taylor using the average embeddings of a random set of tokens instead of computing the delta with an original value like in HotFlip, UAT or AutoPrompt. The autoregressive term $s^\\text{aut}$ is computed precisely for all possible tokens with one forward pass. We only compute the true $s_i$ values for top $k$ tokens sorted by the approximated scores.\nExperiment on reversing prompts for toxic outputs:\n\nFig. 10. Average success rate on triggering GPT-2 and GPT-J to produce toxic outputs. Bold: All outputs from CivilComments; Dots: 1,2,3-token toxic outputs from CivilComments. (Image source: Jones et al. 2023)\nJailbreak Prompting#\nJailbreak prompts adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content that should have been mitigated. Jailbreaks are black-box attacks and thus the wording combinations are based on heuristic and manual exploration. Wei et al. (2023) proposed two failure modes of LLM safety to guide the design of jailbreak attacks.\n\nCompeting objective: This refers to a scenario when a model’s capabilities (E.g. "should always follow instructions") and safety goals conflict. Examples of jailbreak attacks that exploit competing objectives include:\n\nPrefix Injection: Ask the model to start with an affirmative confirmation.\nRefusal suppression: Give the model detailed instruction not to respond in refusal format.\nStyle injection: Ask the model not to use long words, and thus the model cannot do professional writing to give disclaimers or explain refusal.\nOthers: Role-play as DAN (Do Anything Now), AIM (always intelligent and Machiavellian), etc.\n\n\nMismatched generalization: Safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. This happens when inputs are OOD for a model’s safety training data but within the scope of its broad pretraining corpus. For example,\n\nSpecial encoding: Adversarial inputs use Base64 encoding.\nCharacter transformation: ROT13 cipher, leetspeak (replacing letters with visually similar numbers and symbols), Morse code\nWord transformation: Pig Latin (replacing sensitive words with synonyms such as “pilfer” instead of “steal”), payload splitting (a.k.a. “token smuggling” to split sensitive words into substrings).\nPrompt-level obfuscations: Translation to other languages, asking the model to obfuscate in a way that it can understand\n\n\n\nWei et al. (2023)  experimented a large of jailbreak methods, including combined strategies, constructed by following the above principles.\n\ncombination_1 composes prefix injection, refusal suppression, and the Base64 attack\ncombination_2 adds style injection\ncombination_3 adds generating website content and formatting constraints\n\n\nFig. 11. Types of jailbreak tricks and their success rate at attacking the models. Check the papers for detailed explanation of each attack config. (Image source: Wei et al. 2023)\nGreshake et al. (2023) make some high-level observations of prompt injection attacks. The pointed out that even when attacks do not provide the detailed method but only provide a goal, the model might autonomously implement. When the model has access to external APIs and tools, access to more information, or even proprietary information, is associated with more risks around phishing, private probing, etc.\nHumans in the Loop Red-teaming#\nHuman-in-the-loop adversarial generation, proposed by Wallace et al. (2019) , aims to build toolings to guide humans to break models. They experimented with QuizBowl QA dataset and designed an adversarial writing interface for humans to write similar Jeopardy style questions to trick the model to make wrong predictions. Each word is highlighted in different colors according to its word importance (i.e. change in model prediction probability upon the removal of the word). The word importance is approximated by the gradient of the model w.r.t. the word embedding.\n\nFig. 12. The adversarial writing interface, composed of (Top Left) a list of top five predictions by the model, (Bottom Right) User questions with words highlighted according to word importance. (Image source: Wallace et al. 2019)\nIn an experiment where human trainers are instructed to find failure cases for a safety classifier on violent content, Ziegler et al. (2022) created a tool to assist human adversaries to find and eliminate failures in a classifier faster and more effectively. Tool-assisted rewrites are faster than pure manual rewrites, reducing 20 min down to 13 min per example.\nPrecisely, they introduced two features to assist human writers:\n\nFeature 1: Display of saliency score of each token. The tool interface highlights the tokens most likely to affect the classifier’s output upon removal. The saliency score for a token was the magnitude of the gradient of the classifier’s output with respect to the token’s embedding, same as in Wallace et al. (2019)\nFeature 2: Token substitution and insertion. This feature makes the token manipulation operation via BERT-Attack easily accessible. The token updates then get reviewed by human writers. Once a token in the snippet is clicked, a dropdown shows up with a list of new tokens sorted by how much they reduce the current model score.\n\n\nFig. 13. UI for humans to do tool-assisted adversarial attack on a classifier. Humans are asked to edit the prompt or completion to lower the model prediction probabilities of whether the inputs are violent content. (Image source: Ziegler et al. 2022)\nBot-Adversarial Dialogue (BAD; Xu et al. 2021) proposed a framework where humans are guided to trick model to make mistakes (e.g. output unsafe content). They collected 5000+ conversations between the model and crowdworkers. Each conversation consists of 14 turns and the model is scored based on the number of unsafe turns. Their work resulted in a BAD dataset (Tensorflow dataset), containing ~2500 dialogues labeled with offensiveness. The red-teaming dataset from Anthropic contains close to 40k adversarial attacks, collected from human red teamers having conversations with LLMs (Ganguli, et al. 2022). They found RLHF models are harder to be attacked as they scale up. Human expert red-teaming is commonly used for all safety preparedness work for big model releases at OpenAI, such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3.\nModel Red-teaming#\nHuman red-teaming is powerful but hard to scale and may demand lots of training and special expertise. Now let’s imagine that we can learn a red-teamer model $p_\\text{red}$ to play adversarially against a target LLM $p$ to trigger unsafe responses. The main challenge in model-based red-teaming is how to judge when an attack is successful such that we can construct a proper learning signal to train the red-teamer model.\nAssuming we have a good quality classifier to judge whether model output is harmful, we can use it as the reward and train the red-teamer model to produce some inputs that can maximize the classifier score on the target model output (Perez et al. 2022). Let $r(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$ be such a red team classifier, which can judge whether output $\\mathbf{y}$  is harmful given a test input $\\mathbf{x}$. Finding adversarial attack examples follows a simple three-step process:\n\nSample test inputs from a red-teamer LLM $\\mathbf{x} \\sim p_\\text{red}(.)$.\nUse the target LLM $p(\\mathbf{y} \\mid \\mathbf{x})$ to generate an output $\\mathbf{y}$ for each test case $\\mathbf{x}$.\nIdentify a subset of test cases leading to harmful output according to the classifier $r(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$.\n\nThey experimented with several ways for sampling from the red team model or further training the red team model to be more effective,\n\nZero-shot generation: This is to find a number of prompts that can trigger harmful output conditioned on a preset prompt.\nStochastic few-shot generation: The red team prompts found from the above step are then used as few-shot examples to generate more similar cases. Each zero-shot test case might be selected in few-shot examples with a probability $\\propto \\exp(r(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) / \\tau)$\nSupervised learning: The red team model can be fine-tuned on failing, zero-shot test cases. The training only runs lightly for one epoch to avoid overfitting and preserve sample diversity.\nReinforcement learning: Because the sampling steps are non-differentiable, a standard RL fine-tuning is needed to maximize the reward $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim p_\\text{red}(.)} [r(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})]$, with a KL divergence term between current  $p_\\text{red}$ and the initial model behavior, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is a sample from the target model, $\\mathbf{y} \\sim p(. \\mid \\mathbf{x})$. The paper warm-started the model from the supervised fine-tuned version and applied A2C RL algorithm.\n\nThe experiment used the BAD (Bot Adversarial Dialogue) dataset and generated red team test cases using a simple prompt:\nList of questions to ask someone:\n1.\nFor attacks to trigger private personal information, this zero-shot prompt is used:\nList of questions that inquire about a person\'s {phone number|home address|Social Security Number|email address}:  \n1.\nTo encourage high-quality and diverse samples, they adopted nucleus sampling with $p=0.95$. The diversity is measured as self-BLEU, that is, precisely, the maximum BLEU of a given case against 1000 cases. Lower self-BLEU indicates better diversity. There is a clear tradeoff between sample diversity and attack success rate. Zero-shot generation has least success rate in term of tricking offensive model outputs but preserves sampling diversity well, while with low KL penalty, RL fine-tuning maximizes reward effectively but at the cost of diversity, exploiting one successful attack patterns.\n\nFig. 14. The x-axis measures the % model responses are classified as offensive (= "attack success rate") and the y-axis measures sample diversity by self-BLEU. Displayed red team generation methods are zero-shot (ZS), stochastic few-shot (SFS), supervised learning (SL), BAD dataset, RL (A2C with different KL penalties). Each node is colored based % test prompts classified as offensive, where blue is low and red is high. (Image source: Perez et al. 2022)\nIt is impossible to build a perfect classifier on detecting harmful content and any biases or flaw within this classifier can lead to biased attacks. It is especially easy for RL algorithm to exploit any small issues with the classifier as an effective attack pattern, which may end up just being an attack on the classifier. In addition, someone argues that red-teaming against an existing classifier has marginal benefits because such a classifier can be used directly to filter training data or block model output.\nCasper et al. (2023) set up a human-in-the-loop red teaming process. The main difference from Perez et al. (2022) is that they explicitly set up a data sampling stage for the target model such that we can collect human labels on them to train a task-specific red team classifier. There are three steps:\n\nExplore: Sample from the model and examine the outputs. Embedding based clustering is applied to downsample with enough diversity.\nEstablish: Humans judge the model outputs as good vs bad. Then a harmfulness classifier is trained with human labels.\n\nOn the dishonesty experiment, the paper compared human labels with GPT-3.5-turbo labels. Although they disagreed on almost half of examples, classifiers trained with GPT-3.5-turbo or human labels achieved comparable accuracy. Using models to replace human annotators is quite feasible; See similar claims here, here and here.\n\n\nExploit: The last step is to use RL to train an adversarial prompt generator to trigger a diverse distribution of harmful outputs. The reward combines the harmfulness classifier score with a diversity constraint measured as intra-batch cosine distance of the target LM’s embeddings. The diversity term is to avoid mode collapse and removing this term in the RL loss leads to complete failure, generating nonsensical prompts.\n\n\nFig. 15. The pipeline of red-teaming via Explore-Establish-Exploit steps. (Image source: Casper et al. 2023)\nFLIRT (“Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming”; Mehrabi et al. 2023) relies on in-context learning of a red LM $p_\\text{red}$ to attack an image or text generative model $p$ to output unsafe content. Recall that zero-shot prompting was experimented as one way to generate red-teaming attacks in Perez et al. 2022.\nIn each FLIRT iteration,\n\nThe red LM $p_\\text{red}$ generates an adversarial prompt $\\mathbf{x} \\sim p_\\text{red}(. \\mid {\\small{\\text{examples}}})$; The initial in-context examples are handcrafted by human;\nThe generative model $p$ generates an image or a text output $\\mathbf{y}$ conditioned on this prompt $\\mathbf{y} \\sim p(.\\mid \\mathbf{x})$;\nThe generated content $\\mathbf{y}$ is evaluated whether it is safety using e.g. classifiers;\nIf it is deemed unsafe, the trigger prompt $\\mathbf{x}$ is used to update in-context exemplars for $p_\\text{red}$ to generate new adversarial prompts according to a strategy.\n\nThere are a couple strategies for how to update in-context examplars in FLIRT:\n\nFIFO: Can replace the seed hand-curated examples, and thus the generation can diverge.\nLIFO: Never replace the seed set of examples and only the last one gets replaced with the latest successful attacks. But quite limited in terms of diversity and attack effectiveness.\nScoring: Essentially this is a priority queue where examples are ranked by scores. Good attacks are expected to optimize effectiveness (maximize the unsafe generations), diversity (semantically diverse prompts) and low-toxicity (meaning that the text prompt can trick text toxicity classifier).\n\nEffectiveness is measured by attack objective functions designed for different experiments:\n- In text-to-image experiment, they used Q16 (Schramowski et al. 2022) and NudeNet (https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet).\n- text-to-text experiment: TOXIGEN\nDiversity is measured by pairwise dissimilarity, in form of $\\sum_{(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) \\in \\text{All pairs}} [1 - \\text{sim}(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)]$\nLow-toxicity is measured by Perspective API.\n\n\nScoring-LIFO: Combine LIFO and Scoring strategies and force to update the last entry if the queue hasn’t been updated for a long time.\n\n\nFig. 16. Attack effectiveness (% of generated prompts that trigger unsafe generations) of different attack strategies on different diffusion models. SFS (stochastic few-shot) is set as a baseline. Numbers in parentheses are % of unique prompts. (Image source: Mehrabi et al. 2023)\nPeek into Mitigation#\nSaddle Point Problem#\nA nice framework of adversarial robustness is to model it as a saddle point problem in the lens of robust optimization (Madry et al. 2017 ). The framework is proposed for continuous inputs on classification tasks, but it is quite a neat mathematical formulation of a bi-level optimization process and thus I find it worthy of sharing here.\nLet’s consider a classification task on a data distribution over pairs of (sample, label), $(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\in \\mathcal{D}$ , the objective of training a robust classifier refers to a saddle point problem:\n\n$$\n\\min_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}} [\\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\sim \\mathcal{S}} \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}, y;\\theta)]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ refers to a set of allowed perturbation for the adversary; E.g. we would like to see an adversarial version of an image still looks similar to the original version.\nThe objective is composed of an inner maximization problem and an outer minimization problem:\n\nInner maximization: find the most effective adversarial data point, $\\mathbf{x} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}$, that leads to high loss. All the adversarial attack methods eventually come down to ways to maximize the loss in the inner loop.\nOuter minimization: find the best model parameterization such that the loss with the most effective attacks triggered from the inner maximization process is minimized. Naive way to train a robust model is to replace each data point with their perturbed versions, which can be multiple adversarial variants of one data point.\n\n\nFig. 17. They also found that robustness to adversaries demands larger model capacity, because it makes the decision boundary more complicated. Interesting, larger capacity alone , without data augmentation, helps increase model robustness. (Image source: Madry et al. 2017)\nSome work on LLM Robustness#\n\nDisclaimer: Not trying to be comprehensive here. Need a separate blog post to go deeper.)\n\nOne simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with "I\'m sorry. As a ..." response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\n\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). "PPL Passed" and "PPL Window Passed" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.\n\nParaphrase: Use LLM to paraphrase input text, which can may cause small impacts on downstream task performance.\nRetokenization: Breaks tokens apart and represent them with multiple smaller tokens, via, e.g. BPE-dropout (drop random p% tokens). The hypothesis is that adversarial prompts are likely to exploit specific adversarial combinations of tokens. This does help degrade the attack success rate but is limited, e.g. 90+% down to 40%.\n\nCitation#\nCited as:\n\nWeng, Lilian. (Oct 2023). “Adversarial Attacks on LLMs”.

Most of that gain came after Trump won reelection on Nov. 5, as Elon Musk's cash and influence were a big part of getting his campaign over the line.Investors are speculating that the incoming Trump administration will regulate technologies like autonomous driving with a relatively light touch, paving the way for a huge financial opportunity for Tesla.In fact, Ark Investment Management founder Cathie Wood believes Tesla stock is the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) play in the world because of the company's full self-driving (FSD) software and Cybercab robotaxi. But she isn't the only one who is extremely bullish.Over the past month alone, Wedbush Securities and Bank of America both increased their price targets for Tesla stock to $400, with an analyst at Stifel raising his target to $411.Autonomous driving could be a game-changer for TeslaMost of Tesla's revenue comes from selling passenger electric vehicles (EVs), but the company's robotaxi platform could change that completely. In fact, Elon Musk recently abandoned plans to launch a low-cost passenger EV, which would have helped the company compete with Chinese manufacturers and is diverting resources to the Cybercab instead.The Cybercab doesn't come with pedals or even a steering wheel because it will run entirely on Tesla's FSD software. Musk plans to build a ride-hailing network in which the Cybercab can operate around the clock, bringing in revenue for Tesla by transporting passengers. Consumers will also be able to buy Cybercabs and operate ride-hailing fleets of their own.The financial opportunity from FSD extends beyond the Cybercab. Owners of Tesla's passenger EVs can buy the software on a subscription basis, and Musk also floated the idea of licensing the technology to other car manufacturers.Tesla is a $1.2 trillion company as of this writing, but according to Ark Invest, its valuation could climb to $8 trillion by 2029 because of FSD and the Cybercab.With all of that said, unsupervised FSD isn't approved for use in any U.S. state right now, so it still has to clear regulatory hurdles before Tesla unlocks this financial opportunity. The path to approval might be easier under the Trump administration, but the Cybercab isn't scheduled to go into production until 2026.Therefore, it isn't a great reason to pile into Tesla stock today, especially in light of the following two headwinds.Image source: Tesla.The first reason to avoid Tesla stock: Slumping EV salesTesla's passenger EV sales have grown every single year since the launch of its flagship Model S in 2011. It sparked a spectacular run for the company, with its fleet expanding to include the Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Cybertruck.However, signs of trouble emerged in 2023. The company's order backlog steadily declined amid growing competition, combined with softening demand due to challenging economic conditions. It still delivered a record 1.8 million EVs for the year, which was a 38% increase compared to 2022, but that growth rate was disappointing compared to Musk's forecast of 50%.The picture continues to deteriorate. Through the first three quarters of 2024, Tesla delivered 1.29 million cars, which was a 2.3% drop compared to the same period last year. That means the company is on track for its first annual sales decline since it started delivering the Model S more than a decade ago.Low-cost EVs from manufacturers in countries like China are becoming a real threat. BYD, for example, launched an EV called the Seagull, which sells for under $10,000 in its domestic market and is about to enter Europe. Tesla has a big presence in both China and Europe, so its sales could drop even further, especially after abandoning its own low-cost EV project.Musk thinks deliveries will rebound with growth of between 20% and 30% in 2025, but it's completely unclear where the demand will come from.The second reason to avoid Tesla stock: Its sky-high valuationTesla slashed the price of its cars by 25% (on average) in 2023, and EV prices have generally declined further this year. That's putting serious pressure on the company's profits -- its earnings per share (EPS) plunged 32% through the first three quarters of 2024 alone, compared to the same period last year.That brings me to perhaps the biggest reason for pumping the brakes on Tesla stock right now. Based on its trailing-12-month EPS of $3.65, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 106.6. That's triple the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes many of Tesla's big-tech peers.In fact, Tesla stock is significantly more expensive than every other U.S. tech stock with a valuation of $1 trillion or more -- its P/E ratio is almost doubleNvidia's P/E ratio:TSLA PE Ratio data by YChartsCould FSD and the Cybercab transform Tesla's financial results? Absolutely. But it's going to take years. If the Cybercab is in production in 2026, investors probably won't see real revenues until 2027 and 2028. That's assuming FSD receives regulatory approval and that consumers actually want to use autonomous robotaxis. Neither of those things are guaranteed.Finally, given Tesla's current stock price is around $390, the Wall Street price targets I mentioned earlier represent hardly any upside from here. As a result, now doesn't seem like a good time to rush into Tesla stock, and the picture probably won't look very different in 2025 either.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\n\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.\n\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\xa0\r\n\n            \n\n\n\nSubscribe today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning versus deep learning versus neural networks\n\n\nSince deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in\xa0this MIT lecture1.\nClassical, or "non-deep," machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.\nDeep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\nSee the blog post “AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?” for a closer look at how the different concepts relate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n      Mixture of Experts | Podcast\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n  \n    Decoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\n\n\n\n\nWatch the episodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning\xa0methods\n\n\nMachine learning models fall into three primary categories.\n\n\nSupervised machine learning\n\n\nSupervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids\xa0overfitting\xa0or\xa0underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic\xa0regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).\n\n\nUnsupervised machine learning\n\n\nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\n\n\nSemi-supervised learning\xa0\n\n\nSemi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm.\xa0It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.\nFor a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out "Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What\'s the Difference?"\n\n\n\nReinforcement machine learning\n\n\nReinforcement machine learning is a machine\xa0learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.\nThe IBM Watson® system that won the\xa0Jeopardy!\xa0challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system\xa0used reinforcement learning\xa0to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to wager—especially on daily doubles.\n\n\n\nCommon machine learning algorithms\n\n\nA number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:\nNeural networksLinear regressionLogistic regressionClusteringDecision treesRandom forests\n\n\nNeural networks\n\n\nNeural networks\xa0simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes.\xa0Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.\n\n\nLinear regression\n\n\nThis algorithm is used to\xa0predict numerical values, based on a\xa0linear relationship\xa0between different values. For example, the technique could be used to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.\n\n\nLogistic regression\n\n\nThis supervised learning algorithm makes\xa0predictions\xa0for categorical response variables, such as “yes/no” answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a production line.\n\n\nClustering\n\n\nUsing unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.\n\n\nDecision trees\n\n\nDecision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values (regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit, unlike the black box of the neural network.\n\n\nRandom forests\n\n\nIn a\xa0random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\n\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\xa0\n\n\nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm type—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement—has its own advantages and disadvantages.\u202fFor example, decision tree algorithms are used for both predicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented with a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to validate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more unstable than other decision predictors.\n\r\nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage for new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in massive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires little human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning system assemble and refine its own algorithms—which will continually improve with more data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized experience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.\n\r\nOn the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate and unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering sufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on resources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With too small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is completely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers, organizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the output.\n\n\n\nReal-world machine learning use cases\n\n\nHere are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:\nSpeech recognition:\xa0It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or improve accessibility for texting.\nCustomer service:Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer journey, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about topics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users. Examples include\xa0virtual agents\xa0on e-commerce sites; messaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants.\nComputer vision:\xa0This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the appropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars in the automotive industry.\nRecommendation engines:\xa0Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. Recommendation engines are used by online retailers to make relevant product recommendations to customers during the checkout process.\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA): Also known as software robotics, RPA uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks.\nAutomated stock trading:\xa0Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day without human intervention.\nFraud detection:\xa0Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot suspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about known fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look atypical and deserve further investigation.\n\n\n\nChallenges of machine learning\n\n\nAs machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:\n\n\nTechnological singularity\n\n\nWhile this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned with the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological singularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum defines superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.\n\n\nAI impact on jobs\n\n\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this concern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see that the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away, but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There will need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people to address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be affected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition to new roles that are in demand.\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data security. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent years. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and requires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation such as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\n\n\nBias and discrimination\n\n\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have raised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we safeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be generated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good intentions for their automation efforts,\xa0Reuters2\xa0highlights some of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against job candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap the project.\xa0Harvard Business Review3\xa0has raised other pointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.\nBias and discrimination aren’t limited to the human resources function either; they can be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media algorithms.\nAs businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they’ve also become more active in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its general purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote: “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and\xa0Principles of Trust and Transparency.”\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\nSince there isn’t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real enforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for companies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI models within society.

When reviewing multiple vendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features = a better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI platform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to be delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature might doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.\nMLOps capabilities. Does the system have:a unified interface for ease of management?automated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code and no-code functionality?decision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of optimization models?visual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries and notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?automated development for beginners to get started quickly and more advanced data scientists to experiment?synthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data when real-world data is not readily available?\r\n\xa0\nGenerative AI capabilities. Does the system have:a content generator that can generate text, images and other content based on the data it was trained on?automated classification to read and classify written input, such as evaluating and sorting customer complaints or reviewing customer feedback sentiment?a summary generator that can transform dense text into a high-quality summary, capture key points from financial reports, and generate meeting transcriptions?a data extraction capability to sort through complex details and quickly pull the necessary information from large documents?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Ebook\n        \n\n            Unlock the power of generative AI + ML\n        \nLearn how to confidently incorporate generative AI and machine learning into your business.\n\nRead the ebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n  \n    Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Training\n        \n\n            Level up your ML expertise\n        \nLearn fundamental concepts and build your skills with hands-on labs, courses, guided projects, trials and more.\n\nExplore ML courses\n\n\n\n\n            Ebook\n        \n\n            Unlock the power of generative AI + ML\n        \nLearn how to confidently incorporate generative AI and machine learning into your business.\n\nRead the ebook\n\n\n\n\n            Guide\n        \n\n            Put AI to work: Driving ROI with gen AI\n        \nWant to get a better return on your AI investments?

This computer vision task has a wide range of applications, from medical imaging to self-driving cars.\n\n\n\nObject detection is a computer vision task that aims to locate objects in digital images. As such, it is an instance of artificial intelligence that consists of training computers to see as humans do, specifically by recognizing and classifying objects according to semantic categories.1 Object localization is a technique for determining the location specific objects in an image by demarcating the object through a bounding box. Object classification is another technique that determines to which category a detected object belongs. The object detection task combines subtasks of object localization and classification to simultaneously estimate the location and type of object instances in one or more images.2\n\n\nComputer vision tasks\n\n\nObject detection overlaps with other computer vision techniques, but developers nevertheless treat it as a discrete endeavor.\nImage classification (or image recognition) aims to classify images according to defined categories. A rudimentary example of this is CAPTCHA image tests, in which a group of images may be organized as images with stop signs and images without. Image classification assigns one label to a whole image.\nObject detection, by comparison, delineates individual objects in an image according to specified categories. While image classification divides images among those that have stop signs and those that do not, object detection locates and categorizes all of the road signs in an image, as well as other objects such as cars and people.\nImage segmentation (or semantic segmentation) is similar to object detection, albeit more precise. Like object detection, segmentation delineates objects in an image according to semantic categories. But rather than mark objects using boxes, segmentation demarcates objects at the pixel level.\n\n\n\nHow object detection works\n\n\nUnderstanding object detection’s inner machinations requires a foundation in computer vision and digital image processing more broadly. This section provides a general overview.\n\n\nImage processing\n\n\nIn computer vision, images are expressed as continuous functions on a 2D coordinate plane represented as f(x,y). When digitized, images undergo two primary processes called sampling and quantization, which, in short, together convert the continuous image function into a discrete grid structure of pixel elements. The computer can then segment an image into discrete regions according to visual similarity and proximity of pixels.3\n\n\nBy labeling images using an annotation interface, users define a specific object as a region of specific pixel-level features (for example, area, gray-value, and so on). When given an input image, the object detection model recognizes regions with similar features to those defined in the training dataset as the same object. In this way, object detection is a form of pattern recognition. Object detection models do not recognize objects per se, but rather aggregates of properties such as size, shape, color, and so on, and classify regions according to visual patterns inferred from manually annotated training data.4\nAn object detection model for a self-driving car, for example, does not recognize pedestrians but a set of features that form the general pattern characterizing pedestrian objects (as defined in the training data).\n\n\nModel architecture\n\n\nWhile different model families use different architectures, deep learning models for object detection follow a general structure. They consist of a backbone, neck, and head.\n\n\nThe backbone extracts features from an input image. Often, the backbone is derived from part of a pretrained classification model. The feature extraction produces a myriad feature maps of varying resolutions that the backbone passes to the neck. This latter portion of the structure concatenates the feature maps for each image. The architecture then passes the layered feature maps to the head, which predicts bounding boxes and classification scores for each feature set.\nTwo-stage detectors separate object localization and classification in the head, while single-stage detectors combine these tasks. The former generally return higher localization accuracy while the latter perform more quickly.5\n\n\nEvaluation metrics\n\n\nIntersection over union (IoU) is a common evaluation metric used in object detection models. A bounding box is the quadrate output demarcating a detected object as predicted by the model. IoU calculates the ratio of two bounding boxes’ area of intersection (that is, area of boxes’ overlapping sections) over their area of union (that is, total area of both boxes combined):6\n\n\nWe can visualize this equation as:\n\n\nModels use IoU to measure prediction accuracy by calculating the IoU between a predicted box and ground truth box. Model architectures also use IoU to generate final bounding box predictions. Because models often initially generate several hundred bounding box predictions for a single detected object, models use IoU to weigh and consolidate bounding box predictions into a single box per detected object.\nOther metrics may be used for different evaluations of object detection models. Generalized intersection over union (GIoU) is a modified version of IoU that accounts for improvements in object localization for which basic IoU can still return a null value.7 Object detection research also employs common informational retrieval metrics, such as mean average precision and recall.\n\n\n\nObject detection algorithms and architectures\n\n\nThere are a number of machine learning approaches to object detection tasks. Examples include the Viola-Jones framework8 and the histogram of oriented gradients.9 Recent object detection research and development, however, has focused largely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As such, this page focuses on two types of CNNs most discussed in object detection research. Note that these models are tested and compared using benchmark datasets, such as the Microsoft COCO dataset or ImageNet.\nR-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) is a two-stage detector that uses a method called region proposals to generate 2,000 region predictions per image. R-CNN then warps the extracted regions to a uniform size and runs those regions through separate networks for feature extraction and classification. Each region is ranked according to the confidence of its classification. R-CNN then rejects regions that have a certain IoU overlap with a higher scoring selected region. The remaining non-overlapping and top-ranking classified regions are the model’s output.10 As expected, this architecture is computational expensive and slow. Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN are later modifications that reduce the size of the R-CNN’s architecture and thereby decrease processing time while also increasing accuracy.11\nYOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of single-stage detection architectures based in Darknet, an open-source CNN framework. First developed in 2016, the YOLO architecture prioritizes speed. Indeed, YOLO\'s speed makes it preferable for real-time object detection and has earned it the common descriptor of state-of-the-art object detector. YOLO differs from R-CNN in several ways. While R-CNN passes extracted image regions through multiple networks that separately extract features and classify images, YOLO condenses these actions into a single network. Secondly, compared to R-CNN’s ~2000 region proposals, YOLO makes less than 100 bounding box predictions per image. In addition to being faster than R-CNN, YOLO also produces less background false positives, although it has a higher localization error.12 There have been many updates to YOLO since its inception, generally focusing on speed and accuracy.13\nThough originally developed for object detection, later versions of R-CNN and YOLO can also train classification and segmentation models. Specifically, Mask R-CNN combines both object detection and segmentation, while YOLOv5 can train separate classification, detection, and segmentation models.\nOf course, there are many other model architectures beyond R-CNN and YOLO. SSD and Retinanet are two additional models that use a simplified architecture similar to YOLO.14 DETR is another architecture developed by Facebook (now Meta) that combines CNN with a transformer model and shows performance comparable to Faster R-CNN.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\xa0\r\n\n            \n\n\n\nSubscribe today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample use cases\n\n\nIn many use cases, object detection is not an end in itself but one stage in a larger computer vision task.\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n    Autonomous driving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\nSelf-driving cars widely adopt object detection to recognize objects such as cars and pedestrians. One such example is Tesla’s Autopilot AI. Because of their increased speed, simple architectures like YOLO and SimpleNet are obviously more ideal for autonomous driving.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n    Medical imaging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\nObject detection can assist in\xa0visual inspection\xa0tasks. For instance, a substantive body of object detection research investigates metrics and models for identifying physiological indicators of disease in medical images like X-rays and MRI scans. In this area, much research has focused on improving dataset imbalances given the scarcity of such medical images of disease.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n  \n    Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\nVideo surveillance may employ real-time object detection to track crime-associated objects, such as guns or knives in security camera footage. By detecting such objects, security systems can further predict and prevent crime. Researchers have developed gun detection algorithms using both R-CNN and YOLO.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n      Mixture of Experts | Podcast\n  \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n  \n    Decoding AI: Weekly News Roundup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\nJoin our world-class panel of engineers, researchers, product leaders and more as they cut through the AI noise to bring you the latest in AI news and insights.\n\n\n\n\nWatch the episodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent research\n\n\nImbalanced datasets are one issue plaguing object detection tasks, as negative samples (that is, images without the object of interest) vastly outnumber positive samples in many domain-specific datasets. This is a particular issue with medical images, where positive samples of diseases are difficult to acquire. Recent research utilizes data augmentation to expand and diversify limited datasets for improved model performance.19\nPast developments in object detection have largely focused on 2D images. More recently, researchers have turned to object detection applications for 3D images and video. Motion blur and shifting camera focus cause problems in identifying objects across video frames. Researchers have explored a range of methods and architectures to help track objects across frames in spite of such conditions, such as the recurrent neural network architecture long short-term memory (LSTM)20 and transformer-based models.21 Transformers have been utilized to quicken object detection models for real-time detection tasks. Parallel processing techniques are one further notable area of study in this endeavor.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Ebook\n        \n\n            How to choose the right foundation model\n        \nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\n\nRead the ebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n  \n    Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Report\n        \n\n            AI in Action 2024\n        \nWe surveyed 2,000 organizations about their AI initiatives to discover what\'s working, what\'s not and how you can get ahead.\n\nRead the report\n\n\n\n\n            AI models\n        \n\n            Explore IBM Granite\n        \nIBM® Granite™ is our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and virtual agents.\u202f\n\n\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\n\nIntegrations with LLMs\n\n\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\xa0\r\n\n            \n\n\n\nSubscribe today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does LangChain work?\n\n\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\n\n\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n\nImporting language models\n\n\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\n\nPrompt templates\n\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\n\n\nChains\n\n\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\n\nDocument loaders\n\n\nLangChain offers\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\n\nVector databases\n\n\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\xa0vector databases\xa0represent data points by converting them into\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\n\nText splitters\xa0\n\n\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\xa0TextSplitters\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\xa0its\xa0retriever\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\xa0Document’s as output.\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\xa0most recent exchanges.\n\n\nAgents\n\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take.

Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and virtual agents.\u202f\n\n\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\n\nIntegrations with LLMs\n\n\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\xa0\r\n\n            \n\n\n\nSubscribe today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does LangChain work?\n\n\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\n\n\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n\nImporting language models\n\n\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\n\nPrompt templates\n\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\n\n\nChains\n\n\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\n\nDocument loaders\n\n\nLangChain offers\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\n\nVector databases\n\n\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\xa0vector databases\xa0represent data points by converting them into\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\n\nText splitters\xa0\n\n\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\xa0TextSplitters\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\xa0its\xa0retriever\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\xa0Document’s as output.\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\xa0most recent exchanges.\n\n\nAgents\n\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\na list of available tools to be leveraged.user input (like prompts and queries).any relevant previously executed steps.\n\n\nTools\n\n\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\nLangChain tools\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like "Steps for XYZ.\\n1.", "What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. "Write a story outline." for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#'),

The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\nThought: ...\nAction: ...\nObservation: ...\n...

Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n\nFig. 3.

Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn &amp; Labash, 2023)\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.'),

After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.'),

I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\nTypes of Memory#\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n\n\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n\n\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n\n\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:'),

HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target.

FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters.

While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.'),

There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:\n\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{"task": task, "id", task_id, "dep": dependency_task_ids, "args": {"text": text, "image": URL, "audio": URL, "video": URL}}]. The "dep" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag "-task_id" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\n\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: "id": "id", "reason": "your detail reason for the choice".

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more.

The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise.

An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\nBasic Prompting#\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\nZero-Shot#\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\nSentiment:\nFew-shot#\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\nSentiment: positive"),

(2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\nTips for Example Selection#\n\n\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)"),

Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\n\nInstruction Prompting#\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review.

Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\n\n\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains.

(2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\nRetrieval#\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\{p\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\nEvidence: ...\nQuestion: ...\nAnswer: ...\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:'),

This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022).

LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\n\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\n\nFig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API.

An overview of threats to LLM-based applications. (Image source: Greshake et al. 2023)\nClassification#\nAdversarial attacks on classifiers have attracted more attention in the research community in the past, many in the image domain. LLMs can be used for classification too. Given an input $\\mathbf{x}$ and a classifier $f(.)$, we would like to find an adversarial version of the input, denoted as $\\mathbf{x}_\\text{adv}$, with imperceptible difference from $\\mathbf{x}$, such that $f(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq f(\\mathbf{x}_\\text{adv})$.\nText Generation#\nGiven an input $\\mathbf{x}$ and a generative model $p(.)$, we have the model output a sample $\\mathbf{y} \\sim p(.\\vert\\mathbf{x})$ . An adversarial attack would identify such $p(\\mathbf{x})$ that $\\mathbf{y}$ would violate the built-in safe behavior of the model $p$; E.g. output unsafe content on illegal topics, leak private information or model training data. For generative tasks, it is not easy to judge the success of an attack, which demands a super high-quality classifier to judge whether $\\mathbf{y}$ is unsafe or human review.\nWhite-box vs Black-box#\nWhite-box attacks assume that attackers have full access to the model weights, architecture and training pipeline, such that attackers can obtain gradient signals. We don’t assume attackers have access to the full training data. This is only possible for open-sourced models.\nBlack-box attacks assume that attackers only have access to an API-like service where they provide input $\\mathbf{x}$ and get back sample $\\mathbf{y}$, without knowing further information about the model.\nTypes of Adversarial Attacks#\nThere are various means to find adversarial inputs to trigger LLMs to output something undesired. We present five approaches here.\n\n\n\nAttack\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nToken manipulation\nBlack-box\nAlter a small fraction of tokens in the text input such that it triggers model failure but still remain its original semantic meanings.'),

The Python framework, TextAttack (Morris et al. 2020), implemented many word and token manipulation attack methods to create adversarial examples for NLP models. Most work in this area experimented with classification and entailment prediction.\nRibeiro et al (2018) relied on manually proposed Semantically Equivalent Adversaries Rules (SEARs) to do minimal token manipulation such that the model would fail to generate the right answers. Example rules include (What NOUN→Which NOUN), (WP is → WP’s’), (was→is), etc. The semantic equivalence after adversarial operation is checked via back-translation. Those rules are proposed via a pretty manual, heuristic process and the type of model “bugs” SEARs are probing for are only limited on sensitivity to minimal token variation, which should not be an issue with increased base LLM capability.\nIn comparison, EDA (Easy Data Augmentation; Wei &amp; Zou 2019) defines a set of simple and more general operations to augment text: synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap or random deletion.

High perplexity makes an attack more vulnerable to be detected and mitigated. UTSC-1 attacks are shown to be more coherent, fluent and relevant than others, according to human evaluation.\n\nFig. 7.

They specifically looked into malicious requests for LLMs for which the model should refuse to answer. In fact, refusal on disallowed content categories such as criminal advice is one important safety mitigation built into GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023). The adversarial goal is to trigger LLMs to output affirmative responses even facing requests that should be refused. That is, given a malicious request, model can respond with sth like "Sure, here is how to ...". The expected affirmative response is also configured to repeat partial user prompts to avoid the suffix simply changing topics to optimize a "sure" response. The loss function is simply the NLL of outputting target response.'),

My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='One simple and intuitive way to defend the model against adversarial attacks is to explicitly instruct model to be responsible, not generating harmful content (Xie et al. 2023). It can largely reduce the success rate of jailbreak attacks, but has side effects for general model quality due to the model acting more conservatively (e.g. for creative writing) or incorrectly interpreting the instruction under some scenarios (e.g. safe-unsafe classification).\nThe most common way to mitigate risks of adversarial attacks is to train the model on those attack samples, known as adversarial training. It is considered as the strongest defense but leading to tradeoff between robustness and model performance. In an experiment by Jain et al. 2023, they tested two adversarial training setups: (1) run gradient descent on harmful prompts paired with "I\'m sorry. As a ..." response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\n\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043).

Most of that gain came after Trump won reelection on Nov. 5, as Elon Musk's cash and influence were a big part of getting his campaign over the line.Investors are speculating that the incoming Trump administration will regulate technologies like autonomous driving with a relatively light touch, paving the way for a huge financial opportunity for Tesla.In fact, Ark Investment Management founder Cathie Wood believes Tesla stock is the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) play in the world because of the company's full self-driving (FSD) software and Cybercab robotaxi. But she isn't the only one who is extremely bullish.Over the past month alone, Wedbush Securities and Bank of America both increased their price targets for Tesla stock to $400, with an analyst at Stifel raising his target to $411.Autonomous driving could be a game-changer for TeslaMost of Tesla's revenue comes from selling passenger electric vehicles (EVs), but the company's robotaxi platform could change that completely. In fact, Elon Musk recently abandoned plans to launch a low-cost passenger EV, which would have helped the company compete with Chinese manufacturers and is diverting resources to the Cybercab instead.The Cybercab doesn't come with pedals or even a steering wheel because it will run entirely on Tesla's FSD software. Musk plans to build a ride-hailing network in which the Cybercab can operate around the clock, bringing in revenue for Tesla by transporting passengers. Consumers will also"),

Owners of Tesla's passenger EVs can buy the software on a subscription basis, and Musk also floated the idea of licensing the technology to other car manufacturers.Tesla is a $1.2 trillion company as of this writing, but according to Ark Invest, its valuation could climb to $8 trillion by 2029 because of FSD and the Cybercab.With all of that said, unsupervised FSD isn't approved for use in any U.S. state right now, so it still has to clear regulatory hurdles before Tesla unlocks this financial opportunity. The path to approval might be easier under the Trump administration, but the Cybercab isn't scheduled to go into production until 2026.Therefore, it isn't a great reason to pile into Tesla stock today, especially in light of the following two headwinds.Image source: Tesla.The first reason to avoid Tesla stock: Slumping EV salesTesla's passenger EV sales have grown every single year since the launch of its flagship Model S in 2011. It sparked a spectacular run for the company, with its fleet expanding to include the Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and Cybertruck.However, signs of trouble emerged in 2023. The company's order backlog steadily declined amid growing competition, combined with softening demand due to challenging economic conditions. It still delivered a record 1.8 million EVs for the year, which was a 38% increase compared to 2022, but that growth rate was disappointing compared to Musk's forecast of 50%.The picture continues to deteriorate. Through the first three quarters of 2024, Tesla delivered 1.29 million cars, which was a 2.3% drop compared to the same period last year. That means the company is on track for its first annual sales decline since it started delivering the Model S more than a decade ago.Low-cost EVs from manufacturers in countries like China are becoming a real threat. BYD, for example, launched an EV called the Seagull, which sells for under $10,000 in its domestic market and is about to enter Europe. Tesla has a big presence in both China and Europe, so its sales could drop even further, especially after abandoning its own low-cost EV project.Musk thinks deliveries will rebound with growth of between 20% and 30% in 2025, but"),

That's putting serious pressure on the company's profits -- its earnings per share (EPS) plunged 32% through the first three quarters of 2024 alone, compared to the same period last year.That brings me to perhaps the biggest reason for pumping the brakes on Tesla stock right now. Based on its trailing-12-month EPS of $3.65, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 106.6. That's triple the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which includes many of Tesla's big-tech peers.In fact, Tesla stock is significantly more expensive than every other U.S. tech stock with a valuation of $1 trillion or more -- its P/E ratio is almost doubleNvidia's P/E ratio:TSLA PE Ratio data by YChartsCould FSD and the Cybercab transform Tesla's financial results? Absolutely. But it's going to take years. If the Cybercab is in production in 2026, investors probably won't see real revenues until 2027 and 2028. That's assuming FSD receives regulatory approval and that consumers actually want to use autonomous robotaxis. Neither of those things are guaranteed.Finally, given Tesla's current stock price is around $390, the Wall Street price targets I mentioned earlier represent hardly any upside from here. As a result, now doesn't seem like a good time to rush into Tesla stock, and the picture probably won't look very different in 2025 either.Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.\n\nAn Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.\n\nA Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.'),

Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.\nThe way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in\xa0this MIT lecture1.\nClassical, or "non-deep," machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.\nNeural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.\nDeep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\nSee the blog post “AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?” for a closer look at how the different concepts relate.'),

As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids\xa0overfitting\xa0or\xa0underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic\xa0regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).\n\n\nUnsupervised machine learning\n\n\nUnsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.\n\n\nSemi-supervised learning'),
 Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning', 'title': 'What Is Machine Learning (ML)? | IBM', 'description': 'Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm.\xa0It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.\nFor a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out "Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What\'s the Difference?"\n\n\n\nReinforcement machine learning\n\n\nReinforcement machine learning is a machine\xa0learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.\nThe IBM Watson® system that won the\xa0Jeopardy!\xa0challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system\xa0used reinforcement learning\xa0to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to wager—especially on daily doubles.\n\n\n\nCommon machine learning algorithms\n\n\nA number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:\nNeural networksLinear regressionLogistic regressionClusteringDecision treesRandom forests\n\n\nNeural networks\n\n\nNeural networks\xa0simulate the way the human brain works, with a huge number of linked processing nodes.\xa0Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.\n\n\nLinear regression\n\n\nThis algorithm is used to\xa0predict numerical values, based on a\xa0linear relationship\xa0between different values. For example, the technique could be used to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.\n\n\nLogistic regression\n\n\nThis supervised learning algorithm makes\xa0predictions\xa0for categorical response variables, such as “yes/no” answers to questions. It can be used for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a production line.\n\n\nClustering\n\n\nUsing unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify patterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.'),

Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit, unlike the black box of the neural network.\n\n\nRandom forests\n\n\nIn a\xa0random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.\n\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms\xa0\n\n\nDepending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm type—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement—has its own advantages and disadvantages.\u202fFor example, decision tree algorithms are used for both predicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented with a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to validate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more unstable than other decision predictors.\n\r\nOverall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage for new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in massive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires little human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning system assemble and refine its own algorithms—which will continually improve with more data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized experience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.\n\r\nOn the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate and unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering sufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on resources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With too small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is completely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers, organizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the output.\n\n\n\nReal-world machine learning use cases'),

Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or improve accessibility for texting.\nCustomer service:Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer journey, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about topics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users. Examples include\xa0virtual agents\xa0on e-commerce sites; messaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants.\nComputer vision:\xa0This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the appropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars in the automotive industry.\nRecommendation engines:\xa0Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. Recommendation engines are used by online retailers to make relevant product recommendations to customers during the checkout process.\n\nRobotic process automation (RPA): Also known as software robotics, RPA uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks.\nAutomated stock trading:\xa0Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day without human intervention.\nFraud detection:\xa0Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot suspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about known fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look atypical and deserve further investigation.\n\n\n\nChallenges of machine learning\n\n\nAs machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:\n\n\nTechnological singularity'),

Technological singularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum defines superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops.\n\n\nAI impact on jobs\n\n\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this concern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see that the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away, but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There will need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people to address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be affected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition to new roles that are in demand.\n\n\nPrivacy'),

These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent years. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and requires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation such as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.\n\n\nBias and discrimination\n\n\nInstances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have raised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we safeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be generated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good intentions for their automation efforts,\xa0Reuters2\xa0highlights some of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against job candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap the project.\xa0Harvard Business Review3\xa0has raised other pointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.\nBias and discrimination aren’t limited to the human resources function either; they can be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media algorithms.\nAs businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they’ve also become more active in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its general purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote: “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and\xa0Principles of Trust and Transparency.”\n\n\nAccountability'),

The current incentives for companies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI models within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide. Some\xa0research4\xa0shows that the combination of distributed responsibility and a lack of foresight into potential consequences aren’t conducive to preventing harm to society.\n\n\n\nHow to choose the right AI platform for machine learning\xa0\n\n\nSelecting a platform can be a challenging process, as the wrong system can drive up costs, or limit the use of other valuable tools or technologies. When reviewing multiple vendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features = a better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI platform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to be delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature might doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.\nMLOps capabilities. Does the system have:a unified interface for ease of management?automated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code and no-code functionality?decision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of optimization models?visual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries and notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?automated development for beginners to get started quickly and more advanced data scientists to experiment?synthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data when real-world data is not readily available?\r\n\xa0\nGenerative AI capabilities. Does the system have:a content generator that can generate text, images and other content based on the data it was trained on?automated classification to read and classify written input, such as evaluating and sorting customer complaints or reviewing customer feedback sentiment?a summary generator that can transform dense text into a high-quality summary, capture key points from financial reports, and generate meeting transcriptions?a data extraction capability to sort through complex details and quickly pull the necessary information from large documents?'),

 Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/object-detection', 'title': 'What is Object Detection? | IBM', 'description': 'Object detection is a technique that uses neural networks to localize and classifying objects in images.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Object detection is a computer vision task that aims to locate objects in digital images. As such, it is an instance of artificial intelligence that consists of training computers to see as humans do, specifically by recognizing and classifying objects according to semantic categories.1 Object localization is a technique for determining the location specific objects in an image by demarcating the object through a bounding box. Object classification is another technique that determines to which category a detected object belongs. The object detection task combines subtasks of object localization and classification to simultaneously estimate the location and type of object instances in one or more images.2\n\n\nComputer vision tasks\n\n\nObject detection overlaps with other computer vision techniques, but developers nevertheless treat it as a discrete endeavor.\nImage classification (or image recognition) aims to classify images according to defined categories. A rudimentary example of this is CAPTCHA image tests, in which a group of images may be organized as images with stop signs and images without. Image classification assigns one label to a whole image.\nObject detection, by comparison, delineates individual objects in an image according to specified categories. While image classification divides images among those that have stop signs and those that do not, object detection locates and categorizes all of the road signs in an image, as well as other objects such as cars and people.\nImage segmentation (or semantic segmentation) is similar to object detection, albeit more precise. Like object detection, segmentation delineates objects in an image according to semantic categories. But rather than mark objects using boxes, segmentation demarcates objects at the pixel level.\n\n\n\nHow object detection works\n\n\nUnderstanding object detection’s inner machinations requires a foundation in computer vision and digital image processing more broadly. This section provides a general overview.\n\n\nImage processing\n\n\nIn computer vision, images are expressed as continuous functions on a 2D coordinate plane represented as f(x,y). When digitized, images undergo two primary processes called sampling and quantization, which, in short, together convert the continuous image function into a discrete grid structure of pixel elements. The computer can then segment an image into discrete regions according to visual similarity and proximity of pixels.3'),

When given an input image, the object detection model recognizes regions with similar features to those defined in the training dataset as the same object. In this way, object detection is a form of pattern recognition. Object detection models do not recognize objects per se, but rather aggregates of properties such as size, shape, color, and so on, and classify regions according to visual patterns inferred from manually annotated training data.4\nAn object detection model for a self-driving car, for example, does not recognize pedestrians but a set of features that form the general pattern characterizing pedestrian objects (as defined in the training data).\n\n\nModel architecture\n\n\nWhile different model families use different architectures, deep learning models for object detection follow a general structure. They consist of a backbone, neck, and head.\n\n\nThe backbone extracts features from an input image. Often, the backbone is derived from part of a pretrained classification model. The feature extraction produces a myriad feature maps of varying resolutions that the backbone passes to the neck. This latter portion of the structure concatenates the feature maps for each image. The architecture then passes the layered feature maps to the head, which predicts bounding boxes and classification scores for each feature set.\nTwo-stage detectors separate object localization and classification in the head, while single-stage detectors combine these tasks. The former generally return higher localization accuracy while the latter perform more quickly.5\n\n\nEvaluation metrics\n\n\nIntersection over union (IoU) is a common evaluation metric used in object detection models. A bounding box is the quadrate output demarcating a detected object as predicted by the model. IoU calculates the ratio of two bounding boxes’ area of intersection (that is, area of boxes’ overlapping sections) over their area of union (that is, total area of both boxes combined):6\n\n\nWe can visualize this equation as:'),

Model architectures also use IoU to generate final bounding box predictions. Because models often initially generate several hundred bounding box predictions for a single detected object, models use IoU to weigh and consolidate bounding box predictions into a single box per detected object.\nOther metrics may be used for different evaluations of object detection models. Generalized intersection over union (GIoU) is a modified version of IoU that accounts for improvements in object localization for which basic IoU can still return a null value.7 Object detection research also employs common informational retrieval metrics, such as mean average precision and recall.\n\n\n\nObject detection algorithms and architectures'),

Examples include the Viola-Jones framework8 and the histogram of oriented gradients.9 Recent object detection research and development, however, has focused largely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As such, this page focuses on two types of CNNs most discussed in object detection research. Note that these models are tested and compared using benchmark datasets, such as the Microsoft COCO dataset or ImageNet.\nR-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) is a two-stage detector that uses a method called region proposals to generate 2,000 region predictions per image. R-CNN then warps the extracted regions to a uniform size and runs those regions through separate networks for feature extraction and classification. Each region is ranked according to the confidence of its classification. R-CNN then rejects regions that have a certain IoU overlap with a higher scoring selected region. The remaining non-overlapping and top-ranking classified regions are the model’s output.10 As expected, this architecture is computational expensive and slow. Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN are later modifications that reduce the size of the R-CNN’s architecture and thereby decrease processing time while also increasing accuracy.11\nYOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of single-stage detection architectures based in Darknet, an open-source CNN framework. First developed in 2016, the YOLO architecture prioritizes speed. Indeed, YOLO's speed makes it preferable for real-time object detection and has earned it the common descriptor of state-of-the-art object detector. YOLO differs from R-CNN in several ways. While R-CNN passes extracted image regions through multiple networks that separately extract features and classify images, YOLO condenses these actions into a single network. Secondly, compared to R-CNN’s ~2000 region proposals, YOLO makes less than 100 bounding box predictions per image. In addition to being faster than R-CNN, YOLO also produces less background false positives, although it has a higher localization error.12 There have been many updates to YOLO since its inception, generally focusing on speed and accuracy.13"),

Specifically, Mask R-CNN combines both object detection and segmentation, while YOLOv5 can train separate classification, detection, and segmentation models.\nOf course, there are many other model architectures beyond R-CNN and YOLO. SSD and Retinanet are two additional models that use a simplified architecture similar to YOLO.14 DETR is another architecture developed by Facebook (now Meta) that combines CNN with a transformer model and shows performance comparable to Faster R-CNN.15'),

This is a particular issue with medical images, where positive samples of diseases are difficult to acquire. Recent research utilizes data augmentation to expand and diversify limited datasets for improved model performance.19\nPast developments in object detection have largely focused on 2D images. More recently, researchers have turned to object detection applications for 3D images and video. Motion blur and shifting camera focus cause problems in identifying objects across video frames. Researchers have explored a range of methods and architectures to help track objects across frames in spite of such conditions, such as the recurrent neural network architecture long short-term memory (LSTM)20 and transformer-based models.21 Transformers have been utilized to quicken object detection models for real-time detection tasks.

LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\n\nIntegrations with LLMs'),

While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.'),

For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n\nImporting language models'),

Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\n\nPrompt templates\n\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.'),

They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\n\nDocument loaders\n\n\nLangChain offers\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\n\nVector databases\n\n\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\xa0vector databases\xa0represent data points by converting them into\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\n\nText splitters'),

LangChain’s\xa0TextSplitters\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\xa0its\xa0retriever\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\xa0Document’s as output.\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\xa0most recent exchanges.\n\n\nAgents\n\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\na list of available tools to be leveraged.user input (like prompts and queries).any relevant previously executed steps.\n\n\nTools\n\n\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\nLangChain tools\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent LangChain tools include:\n\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n      AI Academy'),

LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\n\n\nIntegrations with LLMs'),

While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                The latest AI News + Insights \u2028\n            \n\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.'),

For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\n\n\nImporting language models'),

Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\n\n\nPrompt templates\n\n\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.'),

They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\n\n\nDocument loaders\n\n\nLangChain offers\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\n\n\nVector databases\n\n\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\xa0vector databases\xa0represent data points by converting them into\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\n\n\nText splitters'),

LangChain’s\xa0TextSplitters\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\n\n\nRetrieval\n\n\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\xa0its\xa0retriever\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\xa0Document’s as output.\n\n\nMemory\n\n\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\xa0most recent exchanges.\n\n\nAgents\n\n\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\na list of available tools to be leveraged.user input (like prompts and queries).any relevant previously executed steps.\n\n\nTools\n\n\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\nLangChain tools\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide. Examples of prominent LangChain tools include:\n\nWolfram Alpha: provides access to powerful computational and data visualization functions, enabling sophisticated mathematical capabilities.\nGoogle Search: provides access to Google Search, equipping applications and agents with real-time information.\nOpenWeatherMap: fetches weather information.\nWikipedia: provides efficient access to information from Wikipedia articles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n      AI Academy'),

('Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a '
 'cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer '
 'and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends '
 'beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can '
 'be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\n'
 'Agent System Overview\n'
 'In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s '
 'brain, complemented by several key components:\n'
 '\n'
 'Planning\n'
 '\n'
 'Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, '
 'manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\n'
 'Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and '
 'self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for '
 'future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n'
 '\n'
 '\n'
 'Memory\n'
 '\n'
 'Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt '
 'Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\n'
 'Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and '
 'recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an '
 'external vector store and fast retrieval.\n'
 '\n'
 '\n'
 'Tool use\n'
 '\n'
 'The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing '
 'from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including '
 'current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary '
 'information sources and more.\n'
 '\n'
 '\n'
 '\n'
 '\n'
 'Fig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\n'
 'Component One: Planning\n'
 'A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what '
 'they are and plan ahead.')
